# Traffic check

## 💡 Inspiration
- Scheduling a trip based on either when you'd like to leave for, or arrive to a desired location, so we came up with an idea of a feature that helps you avoid traffic hell.

## 💻 What it does
- We are given a public dataset which is useful to get timestamps and traffic rate for that time, our app basically gives the shortest path which will take least average time frame among other routes, to arrive at destination.

## ⚙️How we built it
- React Js: For the frontend
- Firebase: For user authentication and database

## ⛅ Use of Google Cloud
- We built authentication system with Google Cloud's Firebase. We chose this because we wanted to make an application that was very very secure. We learned how robust & fast Google Cloud services are and seeing that Firebase had a free plan that was great for us student hackers, using Google Cloud was kind of a no-brainer. Additionally, Firebase Authentication provided a backend service, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries, and the ability to authenticate using passwords, phone numbers, Google, Facebook and Twitter, and the like. Thus, implementation was easy and we are pretty sure we made it incredibly convenient for our users while keeping it secure.
- We are using Firestore as our primary database to store user login/sign up details and Chatroom conversations.
